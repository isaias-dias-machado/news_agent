### [](#authorizing-your-bot)Authorizing your bot

Each bot is given a unique authentication token [when it is created](/bots/features#botfather). The token looks something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`, but we'll use simply **<token>** in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in [this document](/bots/features#botfather).
